# yet another server specific bot

**Please note that this bot was written as a joke and it's name is subject to change**

This is my first project which is a Discord bot written in Python with discord.py

Code of it probably sucks because it's is written by a programming newbie, not by a gigachad

If you want to use it make sure create a file named 'bot_token.txt' and then paste discord bot token to the file
